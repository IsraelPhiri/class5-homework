Instructions on running this dataset processor:

Open the dataset-processor.py file using pycharm
Copy the wine.data file to the same directory as dataset-processor.py in pycharm
Rum the code
As the code executes, a 'plots' directory will be created containing heatmap_plots, line_plots and scatter_plotts 
sub-directories that contain the namesake plots.


Note: there is a plots_samples subdirectory in this repository that contains a few samples of the plots I printed.
      the heatmap plot shows the correlation between features and also the numerical value of their relation in each little squire.
